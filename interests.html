            <h2>Singing</h2>
            <article>I started singing when I was in elementary school, but I never took any singing lessons. However, everyone I know thinks my singing voice is very pleasant, which has given me a lot of confidence in my voice. This confidence has continued, and even now, in my first year of university, I still enjoy singing. </article>

            <h2>Listining to Music</h2>
            <article>Listening to music is an essential part of my life. Without music, my life would probably feel like a zombie existence. The music styles I often listen to include Japanese rock, electronic music, and J-pop. When I listen to music, I focus on how the producer arranges the song, so I don't often listen to popular music from my own country, Taiwan, because I feel like every song sounds similar and lacks variety.</article>

            <h2>Composing Music</h2>
            <article>I started producing music in junior high school, focusing primarily on electronic styles like Future Bass and House. Recently, I've been really interested in creating Japanese-style music, though it's quite challenging, so I still need more time to learn. Since I began, I've been entirely self-taught in music production, covering software operation, mixing, arranging, and more. Recently, I've also considered studying more advanced music theory, including harmony, as I feel my current foundation might not be enough for deeper music production.</article>

            <h2>Exploring Softwares</h2>
            <article>I've always loved exploring various software, as they’re like convenient, handy tools for me. By now, I’ve worked with a wide range of software, such as Photoshop for photo editing, DaVinci Resolve for video editing, Blender 3D for 3D modeling, Unity 3D for game development, and Fruity Loops Studio as a digital audio workstation. I’ve also discovered many helpful websites to meet my everyday needs. Recently, I’ve come across various AI tools that help me complete most tasks even faster.</article>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <article>Although I don’t play games much, I do play some during my free time or when I want to procrastinate. Recently, I’ve been playing first-person shooters like CS2, and in the past, I used to play some RPGs or competitive games. Since starting university, I've had a lot more free time, so I've been able to spend more time playing and exploring games that I enjoy.</article>
